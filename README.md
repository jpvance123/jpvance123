# Hi there, I'm John Vance

With over 4 years of industry experience ranging from cloud solutions, data engineering, and real-time analytics, I‚Äôm passionate about building scalable solutions that drive efficiency and innovation.

As an aspiring leader, I‚Äôm pursuing an MBA in Data Analytics to bridge the gap between technology and business strategy, preparing me to lead innovation at scale.

I thrive on problem-solving, collaboration, and continuous learning, always looking for ways to advance both technology and teams.

## Professional Focus
- **Cloud & Containerization:** Skilled in orchestrating cloud applications using GCP and Kubernetes (GKE), ensuring scalable and efficient deployments.
- **Data Analytics & Full Stack Development:** Developed a comprehensive full-stack data analytics platform that measures material collection efficiency, providing actionable insights for plant operators, stakeholders, and administrators. This platform was honored as a finalist for Recycling Machinery Innovation of the Year at Plastics Recycling Awards Europe 2024.
- **Robust Full Stack Development:** Specializing in building scalable, robust web applications with a strong emphasis on backend systems and RESTful APIs.
- **Dev Experience & AI Enablement:** Deeply committed to enhancing developer workflows through innovative AI solutions and automation, driving productivity and creative problem-solving.

## A Bit About Me
When I'm not coding, you can find me enjoying walks with my wife and our beloved golden doodle. I'm an avid sports fan and love catching a game whenever I get the chance. I believe that strong personal connections and a positive mindset are the keys to both professional success and personal fulfillment.
